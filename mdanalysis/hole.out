 WARNING have not found a CVECT record - will try to guess
 WARNING have not found a CPOINT record - will try to guess
 Input pdb filename read as:    '/run/media/maryamma/One Touch/project_md/project_2/gromacs/2fs/7-3.gro'
 Input vdW radius file read as: 'simple2.rad'
 point in channel: ************************
 channel vector:   ************************
 sampling distance between planes:    0.200

 graphics conditions:
 binary plot output file name: NONE
 Dot density:    10
 Draw dots?           T
 Draw close contacts? F
 Draw centre line?    T
 Produce spikes rather than dots? F
 Seed for random number generator:         0 (0 means value set by program)
 Radius above which a result is regarded as an 'end':  22.000
 Pdb format file for sphere centres: hole.sph

 Monte Carlo conditions:
  no of steps:  1000
  maximum displacement   0.100 angs
  'kT' initial   0.100 angs
 The spherebox and capsule options are turned off.
 (No molqpt card so will not write qpt file of the molecule)
 IGNORE card read so will ignore residue types: SOL WAT TIP HOH K   NA  CL
 no SHORTO card read so will produce full textual output
 As no PEGRAT card was found will not produce PEG polymer exclusion graph
 (No 2DMAPS card specified so will not produce 2D property maps)
 Have not found a CUT card.  Normal calculation using
   Cutoff lists with a cutsize=       1.000
   (if you wish to turn off option use a CUT -1 card)

 Have read     7 bond radius records and
              16 vdW radius records.
 From file: simple2.rad

 Have read     0 atom records.
 From file: /run/media/maryamma/One Touch/project_md/project_2/gromacs/2fs/7-3.gro
 Will not produce graphical output

 Have opened file for pdb format output of sphere centres:  hole.sph
